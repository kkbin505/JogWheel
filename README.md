 # ESP32-S3 Hall Sensor Jog Wheel

This project uses an **AS5600 magnetic hall rotary encoder** with an **ESP32-S3** board to create a DIY **jog wheel** that acts as a **USB keyboard**. As the wheel is rotated, the device sends next or last frame in video editing (DaVinci Resolve), frame by frame timeline scrubbing.

## âœ¨ Features

-  Reads angle from AS5600 via I2C
-  Detects rotation direction (CW / CCW)
-  Frame by frame jog wheel navigation control
-  ESP32-S3 HID support, fully plug-and-play on Windows
